adding trash text;
the purpose is to see how graph tree on git react to changes in dev

2. clean graph tree till now, main in the far left, dev on the right.
adding 2 commits to see graph changes

2.a first commit (after the clean graph tree)

NOTE: worked on local repo till 2.a and noticed, if dev tree move far left, doing in main branc a commit --amend
	(even if no chenge in the commit is done), main branch go back to far  left
	Apparently this tree 'movement' happens only on local repo 'graph' while the github tree graph stay consistent

adding now a new commit (at this moment I pushed both main and dev on github)

as a recap untill this line
	main graph tree is red on the far left
	dev graph tree is green on the right

2.b second commit here (to see ho local graph tree change)
