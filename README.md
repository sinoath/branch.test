# This is a git repo for branch testing
after some test I realized some inconsisten behavior on graphical representation of branches
- github stay consisten on this 'graph' no matter the which is the longer branch or have the more commits
- git (local repo and git log --graph --all) switch back and forth the graph representation of branches
putting on the far left side the branch with the more recent commit (and invertig colors too)
deal with it!
